# surfs-up
Module 9: Weather Data with SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask

Analyzing weather data to determine year-round sustainability for surf shop business. 


------------------------------
# Overview of Project
Through an analysis of available temperature and weather data for the months of June and December, we will identify key differences between winter and summer to determine whether a year round business is sustainable. 

## Project Tasks
The analysis will determine:

1. Summary weather statistics for June
2. Summary weather statistics for December
3. Key differences in weather between June and December
4. Recommendations for further analysis (two additional queries)

## Resources
-- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite

-- Software: Python, VS Code, SQLite, Flask

# Project Results
-- Analysis Output: 

June has an average temperature of 77.2 deg, with a minimum of 71 deg and a maximum of 83 deg. December has an average temperature of 71.1 deg, with a minimum of 60 deg and a maximum of 78 deg.
 
These monthly temperature ranges both support a sustainable business model for the surf shop. Although the lowest temperature in December from this dataset is 60 deg, there are a relatively small number of days below 66 deg. This preliminary data points to the surf shop being a sustainable business, even through the cooler winter months.

# Project Summary

This analysis script can be easily expanded and adapted for further investigation. Additional queries that could be helpful for supporting a sustainability decision: 
-- Average daily precipitation totals for June and December
-- Total number of days over a threshold average temperature over the span of a year (i.e. number of days with average temp above 65 deg).
